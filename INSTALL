First, read the file PATENTS in the same directory as this file.

Fetch leptonica from its website (http://leptonica.com/) and build it.
For this you will also need the standard libtiff, libpng and libjpeg.

If you're running a Unix-like OS, such as Linux, BSD, Mac OS X or msys
 just run:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install (or sudo make install)
