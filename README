Welcome, gentle reader.

This is an encoder for JBIG2:
www.jpeg.org/public/fcd14492.pdf

JBIG2 encodes bi-level (1 bpp) images using a number of clever tricks to get
better compression than G4. This encoder can:
   * Generate JBIG2 files, or fragments for embedding in PDFs
   * Generic region encoding
   * Symbol extraction, classification and text region coding

It uses the (Apache-ish licensed) Leptonica library:
  http://www.leptonica.com/

KNOWN BUGS:

The symbol classification goes wrong with very heavy glyphs leading to gross
misclassification (called cootoons).

BUILDING:

First, read the file PATENTS in the same directory as this file.

Fetch leptonica from its website and build it. For this you will also
need the standard libtiff, libpng and libjpeg.

If leptonica was unpacked in ../leptonlib-1.33/ you should just be able to type
make. Otherwise, fix up the path at the beginning of the Makefile first.

USAGE:

See the jbig2enc.h header for the high level API, or the jbig2 program for an
example of usage. It's very short and most of it is taken up with argument
parsing.
